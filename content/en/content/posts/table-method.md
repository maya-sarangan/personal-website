"This method never failed me in 25 years!!!", declared my dad. He is a 90's kid. You know, the kids who had a secret crush on their teachers(yikes), who played with Tamagotchi(seriously?), who thought the world was simple and beautiful(spoiler alert: it wasn't!) back then, and their old - school method of studying is better(not always).But, I have to agree there are instances where some of their methods are easy to understand and surprisingly useful. 

One such method is the table method, which can solve ratio problems. According to my dad, his teacher taught this method for only one week and he stills remembers it twenty-five years later. I found this method useful and documenting it here. 

Let’s start with an example.

_Maya’s class is going on a long field trip to a science museum. Before they leave, the bus driver checks the fuel tank. He knows from past trips that when the bus travels 45 miles, it uses 7 gallons of fuel. This time, the museum is 120 miles away, and the driver wants to make sure there’s enough fuel in the tank for the entire trip._

_How many gallons of fuel should he expect to use for the whole trip?_

Many people might try to write this in ratios and simplify it to the base unit. In this case you would get a decimal and it will be frustrating to try and find the answer from there. 

There is a much easier method that is guaranteed to work every single time.This method is called the **Proportion Method** otherwise known as the **Table Method**. Here you draw a table with two columns. You must always put what you are trying to find (in this case how much fuel the bus will need) on the right side of the table.Then, mark what you are trying to find with a question mark. Now, you must multiply the numbers diagonally and divide by the number that is on the upper - left corner.The following diagram demonstrates this method:

But sometimes the problem will be **indirectly proportional**, when one number increases and the other number decreases or the other way around. Here is an example:

_30 workers can dig a well in 9 days, how many days will it take for 3 workers to do the same job?_

In this case, you have to build a table just as in the previous one. But, you have to multiply the top two numbers and divide by the number in the bottom - left corner. The following diagram demonstrates this method:

Now, let us take a more complex problem involoving 3 moving parts. 

_10 bakers can do 20 cakes in 15 days so how many cakes can 50 bakers make in 30 days?_

Here, we have 3 moving parts: Bakers, Days, and Cakes. To solve this problem, in each step you must keep one moving part constant, determine whether the other 2 parts are directly or indirectly proportional, and use the table method on them. The following diagram demonstrates this method:

It’s been twenty-five years, and my dad still remembers the table method like it’s the secret to the universe—but ask him where his phone is, and suddenly it’s a mystery even Sherlock couldn’t solve....:-)
