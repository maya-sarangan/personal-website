“Math — it’s a puzzle. I love figuring out puzzles.” — said Maya Lin.

There have been many brilliant women who made history in mathematics, and **Shakuntala Devi** was one of them. She was a mathematician and writer who amazed the world with her mental calculations. She once solved the **23rd root of a 201-digit number in just 50 seconds**, and even multiplied **two 13-digit numbers** faster than a computer!

Her birthday was on November 4th (last Monday ) and in celebration of that, I am going to show you five math problems that seem hard but actually quite simple.

Let’s start!

**Puzzle 1**

Here is an interesting puzzle to solve for X.
