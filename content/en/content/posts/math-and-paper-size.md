Math is everywhere, even in places you will not expect it to be in. It might even be in the sheet of paper that you use everyday...

Have you ever looked down at your desk and tried to find out the dimensions of your paper? Most people do not, but I can change your mind about that. Let us start with the size of A4 paper. The dimensions of A4 paper are 210 mm x 297 mm. But, why? Why is it that A4 paper has to be of those dimensions? Why not 225 mm x 325 mm. Or 765 mm x 150 mm. That is what I am going to explain, along with many other things today. Let's start! 

First, let me list all the different 'A' Series paper sizes:

A0 - 841 mm x 1189 mm

A1 - 594 mm x 841 mm

A2 - 420 mm x 594 mm

A3 - 297 mm x 420 mm

A4 - 210 mm x 297 mm

A5 - 148 mm x 210 mm

A6 - 105 mm x 148 mm

A7 - 74 mm x 105 mm

A8 - 52 mm x 74 mm

A9 - 37 mm x 52 mm

A10 - 26 mm x 37 mm

The following drawing shows you the paper sizes visually:

The pattern in this, if you read them all you will see that the width from the previous paper is the length of the next one. You might be wondering why this is. Here is the reason: A0 is the biggest type of paper and to make A1 paper you split it in half, to make A2 paper you split the remaining paper in half and so forth. This is why A4 paper is always the dimensions 210 x 297. This is also why the previous width is the length for the next one. When you split the sheet in half, one side remains the same length, while the other side is halved — and that’s why the width of one size becomes the length of the next. 

By now you have probably noticed that 1189 divided by two is not 594!!! The actual value is 594.5. But, the 0.5 is ignored for more practical reasons such as the ease of manufacturing, and the paper shrinkage due to temperature, humidity etc.

There is one last pattern that the paper dimensions have. Divide 297 by 210 and you will get approximately 1.414 (Note: The 1.414 is rounded to the nearest thousandth so it will not be exact.). Now, divide 420 by 297 and you will get 1.41 again. Divide 594 by 420 and you will get 1.414. Divide 1189 by 841 and you will get 1.414. Have you seen this number before? It is none other than the square root of two!!! But, this is not just a coincidence, there is actually a reason behind it. Let me explain, in A0 paper you have the length (L represents length) and the width (W represents width) and when you write it as a fraction you will get L/W. But, when you half the length it actually becomes smaller than the width so now the width goes to the numerator and L/2 goes in the denominator resulting in this equation:

``` 
 L/W  =  W/(L/2)
 L^2 / W^2  =  2
 L/W  =  √2 or 1.414
```

This means that whenever you fold an A-series sheet in half, the ratio of its sides doesn’t change — it always stays √2.

So next time someone tells you math is useless, hand them an A4 sheet and say, ‘Congrats — you’re literally holding √2 in your hand.’
