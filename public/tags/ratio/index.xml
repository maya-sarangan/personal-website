      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This method never failed me in 25 years!!!&amp;rdquo;, declared my dad. He is a 90&amp;rsquo;s kid. You know, the kids who had a secret crush on their teachers(yikes), who played with tomagatchi(seriously?), who thought the world was simple and beautiful(spoiler alert: it wasn&amp;rsquo;t!) back then, and their old - school method of studying is better(not always).But, I have to agree there are instances where some of their methods are easy to understand and surprisingly useful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
