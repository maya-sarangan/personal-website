      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, I had an interesting conversation with my friends. It was about different types of multiplication. Surprisingly, they knew only one method of multiplication and in one case did not understand the underlying meaning of multiplication. So, I explained to them the five methods that I knew.I thought it would be great to share this knowledge with others.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;method-1repetitive-addition&#34;&gt;Method 1:Repetitive Addition&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first method is called &amp;ldquo;repetitive addition&amp;rdquo;. In fact,this explains the underlying meaning of multiplication. In this method we simply write out our multiplication equation in terms of addition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
