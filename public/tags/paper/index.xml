      <description>&lt;p&gt;Math is everywhere, even in places you will not expect it to be in. It might even be in the sheet of paper that you use everyday&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Have you ever looked down at your desk and tried to find out the dimensions of your paper? Most people do not, but I can change your mind about that. Let us start with the size of A4 paper. The dimensions of A4 paper are 210 mm x 297 mm. But, why? Why is it that A4 paper has to be of those dimensions? Why not 225 mm x 325 mm. Or 765 mm x 150 mm. That is what I am going to explain, along with many other things today. Let&amp;rsquo;s start!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
