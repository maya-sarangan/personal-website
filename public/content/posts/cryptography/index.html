They had grown paranoid since they hadn’t gotten any new messages for the past two weeks. Until one of them picked up a message through her headphones, she positioned her fingers on the enigma machine ready to translate the message. She translated it and the resulting message was in German. It read “Bitte…Bitte…”, it meant “Please…Please” in English. She was alarmed and she listened for another part of the message, but it had gone silent. This is an example of an alarming situation that the cryptanalysts had to go through during World War two. One very outstanding cryptanalyst was Joan Clarke. She worked at Bletchley Park, a secret codebreaking center in England, in Hut 8. The reason why she was outstanding was because, despite being a female in a male - dominated field, she gained their trust and respect. Because of this, today I am going to show you many different ways of communication during the war, and how to use them. Let’s start!</p>
<p>First, we will start with Caesar&rsquo;s cipher. It is actually quite simple, all you have to do is shift the letters of the message three letters forward. For example, “Khoor” would be translated into “Hello”. Try deciphering this one! “Khoor Zruog” means “Hello World”. A simpler version of this is when you shift the letters down two letters.</p>
<p>You can also use morse code when communicating. When it is sent through the computer it will look like a combination of dots and dashes. During world war two, some messages would appear in morse code and the cryptanalysts would have to translate the Morse code into written text, and then translate that into English..</p>
<p>You can also use grouping. In grouping you group the letters of your message (not including spaces) and if the ending does not have enough letters then you add ax repeatedly until it is five letters long. For example, the sentence “I walked my dog” would be written as “Iwalk edmyd ogaxa”.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you can replace words like “bomb” with other unrelated words. In world war two, people came up with a system where certain words were replaced by Navajo words. For example, “Bomb” would be “chay-da-gahi” (turtle). A funny story that happened because of this is, in a war the soldiers used the word “Tootsie roll” instead of the word “Bomb”. So, one of the soldiers messaged “We need the Tootsie rolls” but the person on the other end was new, and didn&rsquo;t know about this, so he sent them actual tootsie roll candy.</p>
<p>But even without knowing the key, cryptanalysts can sometimes break a message just by studying patterns because sometimes you can tell the message by just looking at the spelling. Because, double letters like ll will appear in the message and you will be able to spot them. And, letters like “Th” and “Ght” appear a lot so you will see them repeatedly in ciphers.</p>
<p>Here is a joke about ciphers, but careful - it is written in the grouping type of ciphers, so good luck deciphering it! <strong><em>Decip herin gciph ersso undsc ompli cated butdo ntwor ryify oumes suphi story probab lywon tnoti ceexc eptma ybeth eToot sierol lincid entax</em></strong>. :-)</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:

Deciphering ciphers sounds complicated but dont worry if you messup history probably wont notice except may be the Tootsieroll incident.
