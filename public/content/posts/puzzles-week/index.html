<p>There have been many brilliant women who made history in mathematics, and <strong>Shakuntala Devi</strong> was one of them. She was a mathematician and writer who amazed the world with her mental calculations. She once solved the <strong>23rd root of a 201-digit number in just 50 seconds</strong>, and even multiplied <strong>two 13-digit numbers</strong> faster than a computer!</p>
<p>Her birthday was on November 4th (last Monday ) and in celebration of that, I am going to show you five math problems that seem hard but actually quite simple.</p>
<p>Let’s start!</p>
<p><strong>Puzzle 1</strong></p>
<p>Here is an interesting puzzle to solve for X.</p>
<p><img src="/images/Problem_1.png" alt="Puzzle_1"></p>
<p><strong>Puzzle 2</strong></p>
<p>Let us make it more challenging, solve for A,B, and C</p>
<p><img src="/images/Problem_2.png" alt="Puzzle_2"></p>
<p><strong>Puzzle 3</strong></p>
<p>Now, let us try a palindrome problem:</p>
<p><img src="/images/Problem_3.png" alt="Puzzle_3"></p>
<p><strong>Puzzle 4</strong></p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t we try two equations at once?</p>
<p><img src="/images/Problem_4.png" alt="Puzzle_4"></p>
<p><strong>Puzzle 5</strong></p>
<p>Here is a true logic puzzle in Shakuntala Devi&rsquo;s style.</p>
<p><img src="/images/Problem_5.png" alt="Puzzle_5"></p>
<p>Finished them all? You might just be the next Shakuntala Devi&hellip; :-)</p>
